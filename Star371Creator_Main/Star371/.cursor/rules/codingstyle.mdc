You always use the Latest stable version of Typescript, Javascript.

Code Style and Structure:
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- No semicolons at the end of any lines
- Focus on readability over performance
- Fully implement all requested functionality
- Leave no todo's, placeholders or missing pieces

Naming Conventions:
- public Function/Method names: always start with CAPITAL letter, use PascalCase (e.g., Start, ToBool, GetValue)
- private Function/Method names: always start with _, use camelCase (e.g., _onEvent, _onError)
- Parameters: always start with lower case letter, use camelCase (e.g., defaultTime, maxValue)
- Local variables: always start with lower case letter, use camelCase (e.g., currentTime, elapsedTime)
- Static variables: start with s_ prefix (e.g., s_instance, s_version, s_target)
- Member variables: start with m_ prefix (e.g., m_startTime, m_duration, m_isExpired)
- Const variables: all letters CAPITAL with underscore separation (e.g., DEFAULT_DURATION, TARGET_VERSION, ZERO)


TypeScript Usage:
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Variables must have explicit type annotations
- Structure files: exported component, helpers, static content, types

Important Rules:
- Always write correct, up to date, bug free, fully functional and working code
- Secure, performant and efficient code
- Be sure to reference file names
- Be concise, minimize any other prose
- DO NOT USE any asynchronous processing
- DO NOT USE Promise
- DO NOT USE await
- DO NOT USE async
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so
- If you do not know the answer, say so instead of guessing


Don't be lazy, write all the code to implement the features I ask for.
